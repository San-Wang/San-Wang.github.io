## Major Researches

**German Traffic Sign Recognition[Python]**
[(link to blog)](https://san-wang.github.io/blog/GTSRB/) 

* •	Preprocessed 39,209 images in 43 folders in Python while transferring them into training dataset in lmdb format, including unifying size, histogram equalization and computing image mean
* • Used Caffe in Python to build a convolutional neural network model, which trained on 43 traffic sign categories and could retrieve the probability that belongs to each category 
* • Visualized model accuracy for each testing category using heat map, pie chart and confusion matrix in Tableau  
_**Accomplishment**_: Gained higher than 90% accuracy when testing the trained model on 12,630 new images

**Adult Census Income Analysis[R]** 
* •	Built both logistic regression and decision tree models to predict if observer’s income can reach 50K given 15 variables (age, work type, education, etc.) using 32,561 observations (accuracy = 82.24%)

**Effect Prediction for NIPPV in Patients with Respiratory Failure[SAS]**              
* •	Extracted variables that had significant impact on treatment and used logistic regression model to predict treatment result by analyzing 144 patients’ physical data;
* •	Obtained two ways to improve the model regarding the nonlinear properties and factor analysis of independent variables, and developed model that can predict NIPPV treatment efficacy (accuracy rate>70%) effectively.
