## Major Researches

**German Traffic Sign Recognition using Convolutional Neural Network**
[(link to blog)](https://san-wang.github.io/blog/GTSRB/) 

* • Used Caffe in python to build a well-trained convolutional neural network model, which can recognize 43 different kinds of traffic signs, which gained higher than 90% accuracy when applied to 12630 new images; 
* • Can use this trained model to give predict result with corresponding probability when apply to new traffic sign images.

**Researcher, Adult Census Income Analysis using R** 
* • Applied both logistic regression and decision tree methods to predict if income can reach 50K given 15 variables (like age, work type, education, etc.) using 32,561 observations (accuracy = 82.24%).

**Effect Prediction for NIPPV in Patients with Respiratory Failure**              
* •	Extracted variables that had significant impact on treatment and used logistic regression model to predict treatment result by analyzing 144 patients’ physical data;
* •	Obtained two ways to improve the model regarding the nonlinear properties and factor analysis of independent variables, and developed model that can predict NIPPV treatment efficacy (accuracy rate>70%) effectively.
