Powered by Jekyll Academic, developed by NCSU Libraries, a template utilizes Jekyll, as well as a theme based largely off of the Minimal Mistakes theme by Michael Rose. Its features include the ability to create blog posts, a dedicated resume page, social media integration and the ability to create and host Reveal.js presentations. It is also designed to be hosted on GitHub pages.
