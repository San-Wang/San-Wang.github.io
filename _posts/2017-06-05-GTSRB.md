## 1. Data Description
This dataset comes from [German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset), which contains 39209 images in 43 folders and each folder contain one same kind of traffic sign images taking from different places and at different distance. And the size of the images varies from 30 * 30 pixel to larger than 100 * 100 pixel. Here is how it looks like:

## 2. Problem definition

Problem type: Image classification
Method: Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)
Software: caffe
Task:
* i. Transfer original data image from .ppm to .jpg
* ii. Using .jpg to create .lmdb data file
* iii. Compute image mean file .binaryproto using .lmdb file 
* iv. Build network construction 
* v. Train network
* vi. Test the network with new images
* vii. Visualize the test result
