## 1. Data Description
This dataset comes from [German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset), which contains 39209 images in 43 folders and each folder contain one same kind of traffic sign images taking from different places and at different distance. And the size of the images varies from 30 * 30 pixel to larger than 100 * 100 pixel. Here is how it looks like:

## 2. Problem definition

Problem type: Image classification  

Method: Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)    

Software: caffe    

Task:
* i. Transfer original data image from .ppm to .jpg
* ii. Using .jpg to create .lmdb data file
* iii. Compute image mean file .binaryproto using .lmdb file 
* iv. Build network construction 
* v. Train network
* vi. Test the network with new images
* vii. Visualize the test result

## 3. Data Preparation
#### 3.1 Transfer original data image from .ppm to .jpg
I use two for loops to be able to automatically go through all 43 folders and transfer all .ppm files into .jpg. 

~~~ ruby
for f in range(0,43):
    # save folder name as the format: 00042
    folder = format(f, '05d')
    csv_path = image_root + folder + '/GT-' + folder + '.csv'
    csv = pd.read_csv(csv_path, sep= ';')
    ppm_name = csv['Filename']
    # len(ppm_name) refer to how many .ppm images in each folder
    for i in range(0, len(ppm_name)):
        # select 1/3 as testing image
        if i % 3 == 0:
            im = Image.open(image_root + folder + '/' + csv['Filename'][i])
            im.save('image_path_name' + 'TestJPG/' + format(f, '02d') + '_' +
                    csv['Filename'][i].replace('ppm', 'jpg'))
        else:
            im = Image.open(image_root + folder + '/' + csv['Filename'][i])
            im.save('image_path_name' + 'TrainJPG/' + format(f, '02d') + '_' +
                    csv['Filename'][i].replace('ppm', 'jpg'))
~~~
In this step, I separate 1/3 of my dataset into testing images (13070) and the rest as training images (26139) by if the name of the images can be divided by three. And here I add the label of the image(format(f,’02d’)) in front of the image name, which will be helpful to define the label for each image later. Now I have all training images in one folder and so do testing images. Next step is to create lmdb file based on those images.
